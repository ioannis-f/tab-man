    <h1>Tab-man</h1>
This add-on was built particularly for real world use.<br>
This add-on implements smart practices for tab managing, bookmarking, history
and clipboard interaction.<br><br>

That said, with this add-on you are able to:<br>

- Organize your browser sessions giving a persistent name.<br>
- Automatically synchronize with the changes you do on the respective window.<br>
  That means if you remove a tab from the respective window this reflects also to the underlying database.<br>
- Keep your window session available even after closing the window.<br>
- Drag 'n' drop functionality to organize windows order at your will.<br><br>

- Copy to clipboard: <br>
  Copy window session to clipboard in an organized way in order to paste it whenever you want.<br>
- Paste from clipboard: <br>
  Paste text from clipboard, grab links with smart routines and finally open a new window with a tab for each link found.<br><br>

- Show window:<br>
  Bring to front a specific window.<br><br>

- Open in Tab:<br>
  Open and use this add-on into a browser tab.<br><br>

- CleanUp command that removes all database entries for windows that are closed and with no name attached.<br><br>

- Bulk operation: Move up, Move down, Copy, Select all, Unselect all<br>
